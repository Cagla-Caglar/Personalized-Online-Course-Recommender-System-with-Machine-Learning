Personalized Course Recommendation System

This project is a machine learning-based Course Recommendation System developed as part of the IBM Machine Learning Capstone. While IBM's structured learning approach guided the analysis and feature engineering, the recommendation system and Streamlit-based application were independently developed. Key model parameters and insights derived from these analyses were utilized to optimize the recommendation process.

Key Features

Interactive Model Selection & Training:
Users can choose between multiple recommendation models and configure hyperparameters in real time. The selected model is trained instantly based on user-defined parameters, providing immediate feedback on performance metrics.

Content-Based Filtering:
Utilizes course descriptions and keywords to compute similarity scores using Bag-of-Words (BoW) and cosine similarity.

Collaborative Filtering:
Implements user-item interaction-based recommendations using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Deep Learning-based User-Item Interaction Modeling with Neural Network Embeddings.

Deep Learning-Based Recommendations:
A neural network embedding model is trained to capture latent relationships between users and courses based on their interaction patterns for enhanced personalization.

Clustering-Based Recommendations:
Groups users with similar learning preferences using K-Means clustering on PCA-transformed feature sets, allowing recommendations tailored to segmented user profiles.

Real-Time Performance Evaluation:
Users can modify hyperparameters via the sidebar and observe how these changes impact the modelâ€™s performance through interactive metrics such as RMSE and silhouette scores.

Scalable Design:
Efficiently processes large datasets, making it suitable for real-world educational platforms.

Web Application
The interactive web application is deployed using Streamlit and allows users to:

- Select completed courses to personalize recommendations.
- Choose a recommendation model from KNN, NMF, Deep Learning-based Collaborative Filtering, K-Means Clustering, and Content-Based Filtering using Cosine Similarity.
- Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., number of neighbors in KNN, embedding size in Neural Networks, number of clusters in K-Means).
- Train the model in real time and receive immediate recommendations.
- Evaluate model performance through dynamic metrics such as RMSE and silhouette scores.
